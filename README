Simple MAVSDK test

Setup steps
    - this code has two different procedures
        - Jetson Mode:
            Install Jetson dependencies for jetson code
        - Server Mode:

Steps:
    1: shared between both jetson and server mode
        - git clone https://github.com/TegranGrigorian/Test-MAVsdk.git

        1: give mods to the install_jetson.sh
            - chmod +x ./install_jetson.sh
        2: run the install_jetson.sh
            - ./install_jetson.sh
        3: verifiy if virtual enviorment is enabled
            - source .venv/bin/activate
        4: Run code!
            - python jetson.py
            
    Server Mode:
        1: give execution permissions to the install script
            - chmod +x ./install_server.sh
        2: run the installation script
            - ./install_server.sh
        3: verify the virtual environment is activated
            - source .venv/bin/activate
        4: edit the hidden.py file to add your Jetson's IP address
            - nano hidden.py
        5: run the server
